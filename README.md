# The-Sparks-Foundation-Task-2-Prediction-using-Unsupervised-ML-
In this project i have used various packages like numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, etc . used "elbow" method to find optimal number of cluster for the given datasets . by using that no of cluster i have trained the kmeans model and predicted the outputs.i also check the accuracy_score of the model by using accuracy_score.
